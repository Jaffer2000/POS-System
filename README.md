# POS-System

In this project, I learned how to build a dynamic front-end using the Vue.js JavaScript framework. I created reusable components to structure the user interface logically, which helped maintain clean and organized code. Working with Vue's reactive data system and event handling allowed me to develop an interactive and responsive POS interface.

# REST API

I also gained experience designing, prototyping, and documenting a REST API for the backend of the system. I created and tested multiple endpoints to handle actions such as retrieving product information, updating orders, and managing inventory. This taught me how to structure APIs efficiently and how to integrate them seamlessly into a front-end application using Axios requests.
